        'areas, with any other type of conservation figures, or even with designation with maritime sectors that are ' +

        'Within the process of MSP, it is essential to consider and collect data on the oceanographic and climatic ' +
        'conditions. A variety of different parameters are considered under this data cluster, incorporating issues ' +
        'related to physical aspects (e.g., sea temperature and salinity, atmospheric pressure, bathymetry, winds, ' +

        'INSPIRE Classification Land Use System (HILUCS)</strong>. It applies nested hierarchies, providing a broad to specific' +

        'the Integrated Maritime Policy for the European Union and in the Directive 2014/89/EU establishing a ' +
