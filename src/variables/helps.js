    '7 DATA CLUSTER':
        'The <strong>analysis of “input” data is based on the MSP data framework<sup>1</sup></strong>, which organises all required input data for the MSP process in seven thematic clusters CLUSTERS: <br>' +

        '(ii) marine & coastal conservation; <br>' +
        '(iii) oceanographic characteristics & climate; <br>' +

        '(vii) governance.',

        'Information on the marine environment is considered essential within the MSP methodology, as part of the necessary ' +
        'assessment of environmental sustainability of the maritime activities considered under the MSP process. <br>'+

        '(MSFD) and the Water Framework Directive (WFD) for the marine and coastal spaces, respectively',

        'assess the potential (in)compatibilities of specific uses and activities with marine and coastal protected ' +
        'areas, with any other type of conservation figures, or even with designation with maritime sectors that are ' +
        'managed by MSP.',
    'Oceanographic characteristics and climate':
        'Within the process of MSP, it is essential to consider and collect data on the oceanographic and climatic ' +
        'conditions. A variety of different parameters are considered under this data cluster, incorporating issues ' +
        'related to physical aspects (e.g., sea temperature and salinity, atmospheric pressure, bathymetry, winds, ' +
        'currents, waves, etc.), and chemical aspects (oxygen, nutrients, dissolved organic carbon, etc.), among ' +
        'others.',
    'Coastal land use and planning':
        'Within the process of MSP, it is key to deliver land-sea interaction analysis, a review of potential ' +
        'conflicts, and synergies between maritime sectors and coastal human activities. This type of study requires ' +
        'data collection of coastal land use (anthropogenic activities within the coastal belt).',
    'Operative maritime activities and planning → and MSP':
        'To understand the current distribution of the maritime sectors it is necessary to <strong>collect spatial data on human ' +
        'activities within the marine areas that are included in the planning area. </strong> on the distribution of the ' +
        'fisheries, maritime transport, nautical activities, aquaculture, renewable energy, mineral extraction, ' +
        'maritime tourism, etc., are necessary to assess potential spatial conflicts, but also synergies between ' +
        'maritime and coastal sectors.',
    'Socio-economic information':
        'The application of an ecosystem-based approach within the MSP process contributes to finding the balance ' +
        'between the conservation of the marine environment and the use of the marine and coastal resources, while ' +
        'promoting the sustainable development and growth of the marine and coastal economies, as presented within ' +
        'the Integrated Maritime Policy for the European Union and in the Directive 2014/89/EU establishing a ' +
        'framework for maritime spatial planning. It is necessary to understand the needs for development of the ' +
        'maritime sectors and identify how to incorporate the environmental trade-offs in the MSP equation.',
    'Governance information':
        'The incorporation of the Governance information cluster is key as it includes the information and data of two ' +
        'key elements.<br>The first component is related to the need to understand and consider within the MSP process ' +
        'the <strong>competences distribution of the different levels of the public administration within the area of ' +
        'planning.</strong><br>The second component of the Governance cluster refers to the varied regulation that applies to ' +
        'the area of planning, including the marine, but also coastal areas.'
